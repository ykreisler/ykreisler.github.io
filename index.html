            <h5>Written in southern Arizona; summer of 2020</h5>
            <p>
                the sun beats down upon the darker days
                <br>the light that peeks out through the morning haze
                <br>the smell of smoke that fills you
                <br>the endless ropes that pull you
                <br>in a thousand different ways to run away
                <br>
                <br>the walls have taken on a different shape
                <br>whisper that your faults are my mistake
                <br>at silent times I hear it 
                <br>the fear that's closed within it
                <br>again and up and over for its sake
                <br>
                <br>close your eyes to the 
                <br>sad disguise
                <br>helpless cries
                <br>caught in your headlights  
                <br>
                <br>symphonies of noises sing to you
                <br>deaf to all your friends who laugh at you
                <br>like blaring car alarms
                <br>your only focus is on
                <br>holding on to what you hope is true
                <br> 
                <br>laugh it off as if it's nothing new
                <br>bite your tongue and hope it passes through
                <br>the creeping feeling that
                <br>your moments over and
                <br>you grabbed on something bigger than you knew
                <br> 
                <br>you feel the urgency; the cumbersome mundane
                <br>to punch your clock and hope it punches back again
                <br>you sing yourself to sleep
                <br>in lying lullabies and
                <br>hoping that tomorrow you'll find peace  
                <br>
                <br>close your eyes to the 
                <br>sad disguise
                <br>helpless cries
                <br>caught in your headlights

                <br>
                <br>the cries you scream for freedom 
                <br>amidst the prophecies of gloom 
                <br>the weight of all the world weighs down and you can't help but to consume 
                <br>
                <br>the rear view mirror reflects the time that you burned while
                <br>feeling past what fell into your eyes
                <br>illuminating, reframing that which you won't find
                <br>chained inside this present moment's rhyme
                <br>
                <br>the cluttered streets that sing to you
                <br>the moment stands and looms
                <br>and everywhere you've gone leads on to another empty room
                <br>
                <br>the static sings out dissonance 
                <br>the skies are tuned to gray
                <br>but the sun behind the clouds 
                <br>is worth whatever price I'd pay
